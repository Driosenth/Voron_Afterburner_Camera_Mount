# Voron_Afterburner_Camera_Mount
Simple modification to the Voron Afterburner extruder to mount a 1-1/2" square camera module.

4X M3 heatset inserts were added to the Hotend Fan Mount.
Two symetrical supports attach to the modified Hotend Fan Mount.
3mm OD M2 heatset inserts in the supports hold the camera module 8mm away from the edge of Fan Mount.
An Adafruit ADXL345 can be attached to a Beam across the supports.

Depending on the camera module, focal distance and brightness may be quite poor. Choose a camera module that appropriate to your lighting situation.
